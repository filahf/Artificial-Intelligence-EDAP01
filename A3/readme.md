### Probabilistic Reasoning over Time

#### Report:

Write a brief (max 3 filled A4-pages) report that adheres to the following structure and encloses the listed points:

- [ ] Summary of the implementation task in your own words
      Description of your implementation, mentioning how you encoded the states, transition and observation model. Do NOT list code!
- [ ] Discussion of your results, answering the question: "How accurately can you track the robot?". To do this, compare your results to pure guessing and to using the sensor readings only in terms of error rates and margin.
- [ ] Summary of the article you read.
- [ ] Discussion of the relation between your implementation and the work described in the article, answering the question: "Is the HMM approach as implemented suitable for solving the problem of robot localisation?". Give clear evidence / motivation for your statement.

#### Passing Criteria:

- [ ] The implementation must be accessible, executable and produce reasonable results according to the instructions you give in the submission e-mail.
- [ ] If the Java-viewer is used, the visualisation of transition and sensor models for a 4x4-grid should look like what is given as example in the instructions, and it must be clear that the visualised models correspond to those used for calculations
- [ ] The report must contain the above listed items.
- [ ] The description of your implementation must actually match your implementation.
- [ ] The summary of the article must clearly be written by you in your own words, so that it becomes clear that you actually have read and understood the overall idea and achievements.
- [ ] The two core questions as given in the report instructions must be answered with motivations for your answers. "Yes, the approach is suitable." is not sufficient, neither would be "Probably not, as we only get it right x percent of the time." (this number is stated in the instructions, thus information-free wrt your implementation).
- [ ] The submission reaches us before the deadline.
